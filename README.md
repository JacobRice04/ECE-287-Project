# High-Level Description
  The project focuses on implementing a hardware-based version of the classic arcade game Space Invaders using Verilog. Space Invaders is a 2D shooting game where the player controls a cannon at the bottom of the screen, tasked with defending against waves of alien invaders descending from above. The player must destroy the aliens while avoiding enemy fire. The use of an VGA module in combination with a FPGA board is required to display and control the game. 

# Background Information
  In order to implement this, a firm understanding of Verilog and its functions is required. The full solution to this problem requires an understanding of Finite State Machines (FSM), an understanding of Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), and combinational and sequential logic.  
# Our Design
  Currently, our implementation remains highly incomplete. After countless hours, we have made little progress with the given VGA. The plan that we were trying to implement first involved creating a separate square drawing module that would intake the location, width, and height of a square to be drawn. From there, it would draw a black square on the white background we have completed.
